# E-commerce Back End Starter Code


## Description
This is the back-end code for an e-commerce platform, which helps interface with the database and start/stop the server. When the database administrator runs "npm start" in the command line, the server will go live, allowing users to view, add to, update, and remove items from the database. These items include products, product categories, and product tags that improve SEO.
